# Celeb-reID

This repository contains Datasets and Code for our paper [Beyond Scalar Neuron: Adopting Vector-Neuron Capsules for Long-Term Person Re-Identification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8873614) and [Celebrities-ReID: A Benchmark for Clothes Variation in Long-Term Person Re-Identification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851957).

### 1.Dataset
You can directly download our datasets from OneDrive [Celeb-reID](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ats-N2hYCkEIgckQF5M5TCsBF0aQZQ?e=IKG16O) and its light version [Celeb-reID-light](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ats-N2hYCkEIgckRrtd0HGhUZPqNcw?e=ziRTjb).
